Chess engines

This project is built on top of the chess game I made ðŸ˜€. This version creats a new class 'GameBoard' that allows for easy pvp, player v computer and computer v computer games.
Both the GameBoard and the engines inherit the Board class from the original project. ( I removed all the draw logic from board to GameBoard)

### 08 - 05
Now I need to make srue Board can pass its board to other classes then I can make the game loop for the ChessEngine
